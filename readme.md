Here is the link to my meal suggestor app:
[Here it is!](https://still-plateau-90455.herokuapp.com/ "Meal Suggester App")

This is a simple web app built with ruby/sinatra/activerecord and psql.

The original aim of the app was to allow users to create an account, post their meal recipes, 'like' recipes they think are good, and then have quick access to recipes that will appeal to them.

My plan was:

*The home page would list the three meals with the most likes as well as the three most recent meals posted.

*The profile page would list, *I* *originally* *hoped,* three meals recommended to the user based on the likes of *other* users who had liked the same meals as the current user. I quickly learned that my idea was lofty to the point of impossible given the time frame and our experience with the tools we are using. As a compromise, I have set the recommendations on a users profile page to a random selection of three meals from all of the meals.

*The all meals page displays all the meals that have been posted and allows users to like (or edit/delete if they created the meal) whichever one they want. This was necessary as i had truncated all the other lists of meals to the 'top' three.
