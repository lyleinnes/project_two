Here is the link to my meal suggestor app:
https://still-plateau-90455.herokuapp.com/
```

This is a simple web app built with ruby/sinatra/activerecord and psql.

The original aim of the app was to allow users to create an account, post their meal recipes, 'like' recipes they think are good, and then have quick access to recipes that will appeal to them.

My structure was simple:

the home page would list the three meals with the most likes as well as the 3 most recent meals posted.
